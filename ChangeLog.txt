V1 - Stable and working - tested on B&H PC and all good except require to explicitly set matplotlib.use to 'qt5agg' or plots are blocking. Wierdly they are not on my laptop.
V1.1 - Tested and put onto B&H PC 02/12/19. Added a check of the gating plot before the main body of code is run, allowing you to stop it it if looks odd. Also added a fix where if the max count in the histo is 1 (i.e nothing except noise) then the pixel is set to NaN and the pixel is plotted as a blank. 
V1.2 - Added the option to enable or disable the empty pixels being set to NaN.
V1.3 - Added bin factor to add the data to enable higher SNR with less resolution
V1.4 - Added ability to load .npy files created with the SPC/SET analyser.
V1.5 - Added binning capability to bin data
V1.6 - added functionality to scale the depth images, now plots both autoscale and scaled in 2d/3d (4 plots) if needed. 
-Added functionality to centre brightest pixel IRF if its anywhere near edges of histogram as results in much improved x-corr with all depths. 
-Fixed the load (non-auto) IRF functionality. 
-Fixed the scaling in 2d heat maps so grid is square. 
-Added functionality to plot any pixel history based on coordinates to check hotspots/empty spots. -Added some print statements.
V1.7 - Fixed the functionality where a 'good' IRF is used to x-correlate instead of the brightest pixel. Needed to scale it. Seems to result in a modest image improvement.

V2 and 2.1 - Began using the Reikna library and OpenCL to implement parallel processing of the histogram arrays V2.1 had a working basic version but advise using with caution.
